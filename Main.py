        "This version was written by Frank King. There was also another version for the TSS/8 time sharing system, written by J.S. Felton and finally a version for the Multics system at MIT by Jerrold Grochow. "
        "The modern game with pegs was invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz, an Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert. Meirowitz presented the idea to many major toy companies but, after showing it at the Nuremberg International Toy Fair, it was picked up by a plastics company, Invicta Plastics, based near Leicester, UK. "
        "Invicta purchased all the rights to the game and the founder, Edward Jones-Fenleigh, refined the game further. It was released in 1971â€“2. Since 1971, the rights to Mastermind have been held by Invicta Plastics (Invicta always named the game Master Mind) They originally manufactured it themselves, though they have since licensed its manufacture to Hasbro worldwide, with the exception of Pressman Toys and Orda Industries who have the manufacturing rights to the United States and Israel, respectively. "
        "Starting in 1973, the game box featured a photograph of a man in a suit jacket seated in the foreground, with a young Asian woman standing behind him. The two amateur models (Bill Woodward and Cecilia Fung) reunited in June 2003 to pose for another publicity photo."

For example, if the hidden code is 1-1-2-2 and the player guesses 1-1-1-2, the codemaker will award two \"Correct\" for the two correct 1, nothing for the third 1 as there is not a third 1 in the code, and a \"Reposition\" for the 2. "
        "No indication is given of the fact that the code also includes a second 2. Once feedback is provided, another guess is made; guesses and feedback continue to alternate until either the codebreaker guesses correctly, or all turns of guest are used.\nGood luck ;)"
